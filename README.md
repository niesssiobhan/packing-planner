# packing-planner
Isn't it stressful when you are trying to pack for a trip that you are going on? You're not sure what you need to bring with you, and definitely don't want to forget anything important. Well we have created a web site that will help you with just that! Go through each step, answering questions starting with the climate of your destination moving on to the activities that you may be participating in while you are there. Once you have gone through and answered each question, we will give oyou a final list of suggested items that you may want to bring with you. Look through and uncheck the items you decide aren't going to be neccessary, click on the last button and TAH-DAH! Now you have your final list of items that you'll need to start packing up. Don't worry though, if there items that you don't see on the list, we have given you the option too manually add your own to make it complete. As you pack your suit case, check off item by item and it will cross it off automatically for you! Our objective is to help you stay organized and keeping that sweat dry from your forehead, not worrying about if you forgot anything. We hope you have a relaxed and stress free vacation!
