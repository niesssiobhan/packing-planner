Meghan is a college graduate and she is taking time off before she decides to settle down and get into a career. During her time off she has decided to travel around the country and possibly even internationally. However, she never used to travel much before and doesn't know what she should pack for the different areas of the country she will be visiting. Meghan needs help just getting started with a list of items to bring along on her trip. She can be very forgetful, so having a checklist would be great and saving it for next time will remind her of what she brought last time.
