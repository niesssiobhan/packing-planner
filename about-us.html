              <p>I was born and raised in Wisconsin, and after high school I enlisted into the Army. Over the next six years, I spent time in South Carolina, Georgia, Thailand, Kuwait, Iraq, and finally ended up in Washington for my final duty station. I currently live in Tacoma, and I’ve been here long enough that I consider the Pacific Northwest my home. When I’m not in school, I spend as much time outdoors as I can. Name an outdoor activity, and I’ve probably done it at least once! I feel most at home in the mountains, and I try to get others to join me to experience everything nature has to offer.</p>

                <p>I'm a mother to an amazing little girl who helps me push myself to be everything I can be and more. I have lived in Washington all my life and absolutely love the pacific north west. In my spare time I enjoy being outside, whether it's hiking up to water falls or just taking my daughter to the park, anything to just get out of the house. I feel that spending time with your family is very important, we help each other become stronger and make it through the tough moments in life. I would love to visit Ireland or take my family to Hawaii in the future some time soon.</p>
